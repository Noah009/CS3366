This project is focused on UI design and implementation of a standard elevator. The Design is based off a picture of an Holiday Inn Elevator and I was tasked to find faults (if any), and make improvements (if any) when sketching my design.
<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />



# Holiday Inn Elevator:

<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

***** Problems ***** <br />
- The first thing when enetering was the operators and firefighter's panel, only looking down you'll find the floor buttons. <br />
- Confusion about the indication on the difference between "HELP" & "ALARM" aside from colors, and shapes. <br />
- a loud buzzer after passing each floor has an emergency tone when heard. <br />
- Digital display is hard to read. <br />

<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

***** Improvements ***** <br />
- Reorganization of panel locations. <br />
- added different background rather than steel to help visual appeal. <br />
- Common use panel is closet to elevator door whereas operator's panel is more to the right. <br />
- Speaker changed to indicate buttons pushed along with digital screen.  <br />
